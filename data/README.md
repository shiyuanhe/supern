# Supplementary Data Files

There are two data files in this folder. 

1. ```SN2008fp_CSP_main.txt```. This is an example file to upload in web user interface of the ```supern``` package.
2. ```sneTable.txt``` is a data table containing all SNe samples in the paper. It has 107 SNIa samples (rows) and 43 columns. 

The columns of the table ```sneTable.txt``` incdlue:

1. SNe. The name of the SNIa.
2. Obs. The name of the survey: CfA, LOSS and CSP.
3. redshift. The CMB redshift of the SNIa.
4. BminusV. The color $(B-V)_{\max}$ at B max. 
5. Type1. The spectral type from [Benetti et al. (2005)](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411059).
6. Type2. The spectral type from [Branch et al. (2009)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0745).
7. Type3. The spectral type from [Wang et al. (2009)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1616).
8. Bmax, Vmax, Rmax, Imax. The max magnitude in each band.
9. B\_scores1,V\_scores1,R\_scores1,I\_scores1. The first linear score of each band.
10. B\_scores2,V\_scores2,R\_scores2,I\_scores2. The second linear score of each band.
11. B\_scores3,V\_scores3,R\_scores3,I\_scores3. The thrid linear score of each band.
12. B\_scores4,V\_scores4,R\_scores4,I\_scores4. The fourth linear score of each band.
13. B\_scoresSD1,V\_scoresSD1,R\_scoresSD1,I\_scoresSD1. The standard deviation of the first linear score of each band.
14. B\_scoresSD2,V\_scoresSD2,R\_scoresSD2,I\_scoresSD2. The standard deviation of the  second linear score of each band.
15. B\_scoresSD3,V\_scoresSD3,R\_scoresSD3,I\_scoresSD3. The standard deviation of the  thrid linear score of each band.
16. B\_scoresSD4,V\_scoresSD4,R\_scoresSD4,I\_scoresSD4. The standard deviation of the  fourth linear score of each band.
